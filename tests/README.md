# Tests

## Unit tests
The unit tests are in [`unitTests/`](https://github.com/ntzwrk/blockstack.ts/blob/master/tests/unitTests/).
They test single components and don't require anything more. Please make sure that they run through before pushing new ones.

## Integration tests
The integration tests are in [`integrationTests/`](https://github.com/ntzwrk/blockstack.ts/blob/master/tests/integrationTests/).
They test whether the current code is compatible with the rest of the deployed ecosystem.

You need to bring an internet connection and some time. Also they probably fail due to some specific circumstances which might not affect the real ecosystem.
